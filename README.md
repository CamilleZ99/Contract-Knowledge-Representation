The contract ontology is constructed in Protégé, regulating the semantic schema for contract data. And contract knowledge in standard form contract (e.g.NEC) is written in RDF turtle. The ontology and triple files are imported into GraphDB where all of the semantic contractual entities and relations can be visulized and queried through the database.
