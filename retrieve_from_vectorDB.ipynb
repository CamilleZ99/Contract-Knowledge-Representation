Here are some knowledge you should remember: The payment process in a construction project often includes these important events placed in time order: Employer receives Milestone Payment Application, Employer notifies Contractor about the satisfaction of the Milestone, Employer issues Milestone Completion Certificate, Employer makes Milestone Payment. Notice that there is a fine line between \"Employer notifies Contractor about the satisfaction of the Milestone\" and \"Employer issues Milestone Completion Certificate\": when Employer make clear that the application is approved or certify relevant documents (certificate), consider this event as \"Employer issues Milestone Completion Certificate\", elsewise the Employer still hold the possibility of further revise or reject, it is considered as \"Employer notifies Contractor about the satisfaction of the Milestone\".\\\n",
    "    Also, many concepts have multiple expressions. Supplier also means Contractor, Employer sometimes is called Purchaser, Owner, or the Company, it can also be represented by Employer's Engineer. Employer receives can be considered happen simultaneously as Contractor submits. Payment application, also known as payment request or payment certificate, is the statement with supporting documents (e.g. project report) submitted to the employer showing the amount that the Contractor considers to be due. Practical completion is sometimes described as being the point at which a building is complete.\\\n",
